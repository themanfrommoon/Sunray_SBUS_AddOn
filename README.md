# Sunray_SBUS_AddOn
Sunray remote control via SBUS (e.g. FrSky)

There are three operation modes:
1. Automatic mode as usual
2. Manual movement control without mow motor
3. Manual movement control with running mow motor
If a failsafe occurs or if the RC transmitter is switched off, all motors are stopped and the usual automatic mode switches on again.
